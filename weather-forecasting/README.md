# Topological-Data-Analysis

Creating an environment that gives you the best algorithm for work for a given set of data -- in the early stage of Phase - I : - trying to analyse weather data to predict future weather using historic data



**This is to sum it up for 2024-07-04**

**1.** This has the code for IO operations from the data -- [in Cpp]

**2.** This has the code for  regression model - simple regression -- linear for prediction [in python]

**3.** This has the data for regression consistiting of 2016 West -- [predictions will be made for 2017 as a proof on concept]

**4.** ppts for changes locally

**5.** Research paper pdf for Proof of reference and Preliminary Understanding required for foundational insight and project orientation

**6.** Finally the Dataset in csv format

**For your usage**

**1.** if you wanna use the Data Set set the Delimeter as comma

**You may not be able to see the data -- set the Delimiter as tab for that separately (or anything else would also work)**

**2.** to use the code

**                 app.cpp - install g++**

**pred.py** - install pandas and sklearn [renamed as scikit learn] -- (be sure to install these using pip and even if the venv if using venv)

**3.** ppt and pdf as regulars
